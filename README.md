# IoT_project
Smart Museum

Notes
- to run the project, each entity must know from its config file the @IP of the catalog
- two databases are required: instructions on their names and tables' composition can be found in the 'DBs' folder
- the provided version works with five Estimote Beacons whose MAC addresses are inserted inside one of the databases; to add some more or change them, it is just needed to modify such data in the DB
